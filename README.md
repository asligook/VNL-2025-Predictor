# VNL-2025-Predictor

A hobby-data science project that uses official open-source volleyball data and aims to predict the winner of Women's VNL'25.

**Background story:** 
- When I was watching the TUR - SRB game played on 13th July 2025, I noticed a little pop-up on the bottom-left corner of the screen during the game which was a prediction(%) of who will win the game, then I wondered how that prediction is made. Then I remembered that I am a computer engineer working in data science, I can come up with my own solution! and started working on this fun, hobby project.

The project repository contains:

- **data** folder : contains necessary files from the official website
- a main notebook named **model.ipynb** which handles data collection, pre-processing / feature extraction and model implementations
- **my_app** folder : Streamlit app that provides a user interface for the tournament simulation
- **models** folder : Saved, trained models that were implemented in the notebook to use in the Streamlit app

After cloning the repository and navigating into the **my_app**:

Install streamlit if it is not already installed :

```bash
   pip install streamlit
```

After the installation, run this command to view Stremlit app on your local machine:

```bash
   streamlit run app.py
```

Now you can simulate the tournament and see the predicted winner! üèÜ

**Ps.** Do not forget to check the official match results after the quarter-finals next week to see what will actually happen.

25.07.2025 update -- Quarter finals are predicted with 4/4 accuracy! Let's see what's going to happen in the semi-finals!
